# Linux Automation


After five year using Linux (UBUNTU), i realized that in the process of
configuring or installing packages you become repetitive in most of the task
you do in [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) system so by making
research, i could find out that one of the distinguishing characterisctics ofan
effective system administrator / engineer is lazeness.

It seemed a little contraditory at first but in the end of the day it is true.
 So in the process of automating things in Linux world, we need a powerfull
script language called [shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script).

# What is a shell script?

In few words, a shell script is nothing more and nothing less than a program
that is executed step by step by a shell, which is another program that
provides an interface layer between the Linux kernel and the end user

# Why i Decide do share this with you

As i already said, repeating things when you want do be more productive does
not help a lot, so i am going to share with you a lot of shell script to
update, install, configure a Linux system.
